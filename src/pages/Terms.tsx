Governing Law and Jurisdiction
All matters relating to the Website and these Terms of Use… shall be governed by and construed
in accordance with the internal laws of the State of New Jersey without giving effect to any choice
or conflict of law provision or rule. Any legal suit, action or proceeding arising out of, or related to,
these Terms of Use or the Website shall be instituted exclusively in the federal courts of the United
States District Court for the District of New Jersey or the courts of the State of New Jersey, County
of Morris. You waive any and all objections to the exercise of jurisdiction over you by such courts
and to venue in such courts.
Arbitration
Customer satisfaction is important to the Company. If you have a problem or dispute, we will try
to resolve it. If we are unsuccessful, you may pursue your claim as explained in this section. You
agree to give us an opportunity to resolve any problem, dispute, or claim relating in any way to the
Company Website; any dealings with our customer service agents; the purchase, use, or
performance of any services or products available through the Website; any representations made
by the Company; or our Privacy Policy (collectively, "Claims") by providing notice to us at the
following address: help@chyeap.com. If we are unable to resolve such claims within 60 days, you
may seek relief through arbitration or small claims court, as set forth below
PLEASE READ THIS PROVISION CAREFULLY. IT REQUIRES THAT ANY AND ALL CLAIMS MUST BE
RESOLVED BY BINDING ARBITRATION OR IN SMALL CLAIMS COURT, AND IT PREVENTS YOU
FROM PURSUING A CLASS ACTION OR SIMILAR PROCEEDING IN ANY FORUM. THESE
LIMITATIONS APPLY TO ANY CLAIMS AGAINST THE COMPANY, ITS SUBSIDIARIES OR
AFFILIATES, OR ANY TRAVEL SERVICE PROVIDERS OR COMPANIES OFFERING PRODUCTS OR
SERVICES THROUGH THE WEBSITE.
IN ARBITRATION, A DISPUTE IS RESOLVED BY AN ARBITRATOR, NOT A JUDGE OR JURY. THE
ARBITRATOR'S DECISION WILL IN MOST INSTANCES BE FINAL AND BINDING, WITH NO RIGHT
OF APPEAL. ARBITRATION PROCEDURES ARE OFTEN MORE LIMITED THAN COURT
PROCEDURES.
By using the Website, you, any Third-party, and the Company agree that any Claim, shall be resolved
exclusively by final and binding arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association
('AAA') applying New Jersey law, except that under no circumstances may any Claim be brought
or arbitrated as a class action… As an exception to arbitration, you retain the right to pursue in a
small claims court located in the federal judicial district or state court of New Jersey that includes
your billing address.
As an exception to arbitration, you, any Third-party, and the Company retain the right to pursue in
a small claims court located in the federal judicial district that includes your or the Third-party's
billing address at the time of the Claim, any Claim that is within the court's jurisdiction and
proceeds on an individual basis. All Claims you or a Third-party bring against the Company, its
subsidiaries or affiliates, or any travel service providers or companies offering products or services
through the Website must be resolved in accordance with this Arbitration section. All Claims filed
or brought contrary to this section shall be considered improperly filed and void.
If you decide to seek arbitration, you must first send, by certified mail, a written Notice of Dispute
("Notice") addressed to: Cheap Flights, 123 Columbia Turnpike, Suite 204A, Florham Park, NJ
07932. The Notice must (i) describe the nature and basis of the Claim; and (ii) set forth the specific
relief sought. If the Company and you, or the Company and any Third-party, do not reach an
agreement to resolve the Claim within 60 days after the Notice is received, you, or the Third-party,
may commence an arbitration proceeding. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement
offer made shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator determines the amount,
if any, to which you, any Third-party, or the Company is entitled.
The arbitration shall be held at a location determined by AAA pursuant to the Rules and Procedures
(provided that such location is reasonably convenient for you, or any Third-party asserting a Claim),
or at such other location as may be mutually agreed upon.
To the extent that any Claim is held not to be subject to arbitration and proceeds in a Court other
than small claims court, such Claim shall be filed only in the United States District Court Northern
District of New jersey or, if there is no federal jurisdiction over the action, in the courts of the State
of New Jersey, County Of Morris, New jersey. You hereby consent and submit to the personal
jurisdiction of such courts for the purposes of litigating any such Claim that is not subject to the
arbitration provision and not pursued in small claims court, and agree that any such claim shall be
resolved individually, without resort to any form of class action. You further agree that any and all
Claims or other matters asserted in such dispute, whether based upon contract, tort, statute, or
otherwise, shall be governed by the laws of the State of New jersey, without regard to conflict of
laws provisions that would result in the application of the laws of any other jurisdiction.
YOU AND ANY THIRD-PARTY FURTHER AGREE THAT NO PROCEEDING AGAINST THE COMPANY,
ITS SUBSIDIARIES OR AFFILIATES, OR ANY TRAVEL SERVICE PROVIDERS OR COMPANIES
OFFERING PRODUCTS OR SERVICES THROUGH THE WEBSITE (UNDER THIS PROVISION OR
OTHERWISE) MAY PROCEED AS A CLASS ACTION, BE JOINED WITH ANOTHER PERSON'S CLAIM,
OR PROCEED ON A BASIS INVOLVING CLAIMS BROUGHT IN A PURPORTED REPRESENTATIVE
CAPACITY (EITHER ON BEHALF OF THE GENERAL PUBLIC OR OTHER USERS OR PERSONS). ANY
AND ALL PROCEEDINGS TO RESOLVE CLAIMS WILL BE CONDUCTED ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL
BASIS. IN ADDITION, NO ARBITRATION PROCEEDING UNDER THIS PROVISION SHALL BE
CONSOLIDATED OR JOINED IN ANY WAY WITH ANY OTHER ARBITRATION PROCEEDING
WITHOUT THE EXPRESS WRITTEN CONSENT OF ALL PARTIES. If you are unable to pay the filing
fee, the Company will pay it for you.
Notwithstanding any other provision of law or any of the Rules and Procedures established by AAA
which may be to the contrary, the Company will not be entitled to seek reimbursement of its
attorney's fees for any Claim the arbitrator finds to be non-frivolous.
With the exception of the class action waiver, above, if any part of this arbitration provision is held
to be invalid, unenforceable or illegal, or otherwise conflicts with the Rules and Procedures
established by AAA, then the balance of this arbitration provision shall remain in effect and shall
be construed in accordance with its terms as if the invalid, unenforceable, illegal or conflicting
provision were not contained herein. If, however, the class action waiver, above, is held to be
invalid, unenforceable or illegal, then the entirety of this arbitration provision shall be null and void,
and neither you nor any Third-party, nor the Company shall be entitled to arbitrate their dispute.
Arbitration rules and forms may be obtained from AAA at http://www.adr.org or by calling AAA at
1-800-778-7879.
IF YOU OR ANY THIRD-PARTY DO NOT CHOOSE TO ACCEPT THIS BINDING ARBITRATION
PROVISION, YOU OR SUCH THIRD-PARTY MUST NOTIFY THE COMPANY IN WRITING BY
CERTIFIED MAIL WITHIN THIRTY (30) DAYS OF YOUR PURCHASE OR BEFORE YOU BEGIN TO USE
THE SERVICES PURCHASED ON THIS SITE, WHICHEVER DATE IS SOONER. SUCH NOTICE SHALL

UNLESS AND UNTIL THE COMPANY NOTIFIES YOU OR SUCH THIRD-PARTY OTHERWISE. THE
COMPANY SHALL HAVE THE RIGHT TO PROHIBIT YOUR AND SUCH THIRD-PARTY'S FUTURE
PURCHASE OF SERVICES OR PRODUCTS ON THIS WEBSITE.

in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey or, if there is no federal jurisdiction,
in the courts of the State of New Jersey located in County of Morris, New Jersey.
Limitation on Time to File Claims
ANY CAUSE OF ACTION OR CLAIM YOU MAY HAVE ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THESE
TERMS OF USE OR THE WEBSITE MUST BE COMMENCED WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR AFTER THE
CAUSE OF ACTION ACCRUES, OTHERWISE, SUCH CAUSE OF ACTION OR CLAIM IS
PERMANENTLY BARRED.

deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or condition or a waiver of any other term or
condition, and any failure of the Company to assert a right or provision under these Terms of Use
shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.
If any provision of these Terms of Use is held by a court or other tribunal of competent jurisdiction
to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable for any reason, such provision shall be eliminated or limited

Price Lock Terms & Conditions
The "Price Lock" (hereinafter referred to as the "Product") is a price guarantee providing the right,
but not the obligation, for the purchaser ("User") to secure a specified airline ticket price during a
designated period for a predetermined fee. This Product mitigates the risk of airfare fluctuations
for the User within the specified time frame. The Company offers locks for varying durations, and
Users should carefully select the desired lock period. The Price Lock primarily comprises
compensation for the risk of fare changes and transaction servicing fees. By purchasing the
Product, the User agrees to adhere strictly to the terms and conditions outlined herein. The terms
may include, but are not limited to, the following provisions. The Company (Cheap Flights) reserves
the sole discretion to incorporate any additional information deemed necessary to adequately
describe the Product terms.
By purchasing the Product, the User accepts the Terms and Conditions stated herein. These terms
may include, but are not limited to:
The Price Lock fee is non-refundable. Price lock fee will be adjusted to the total fare of the price at
the time of full payment. Additionally, the User must pay the agreed amount for the airline ticket if
exercised according to the Price lock terms. The Lock Fee is calculated to minimize the User's risk
and protect against fare increases within the Lock Exercise Time (as defined below). If the User
exercises their Lock during the Lock Exercise Time and the fare exceeds the locked-in amount, the
Company will cover the difference on behalf of the User.
The Price Lock excludes any fees, surcharges, upgrades, or additional value-added products or
services not required for travel, such as baggage fees, seating fees, cancellation/change/refund
fees and other ancillary items.
The Product is offered for eligible fares for flights departing more than three (3) days from the lock
expiration time, subject to change without prior notice. "Price Lock Exercise Time" refers to the
time when lock exercise is permissible. "Price Lock Expiration Time" is the last permissible time
to exercise the Lock.
The Product is available only for all Cabin Types and for certain flights, which include, both flights
within The United States of America and International travel. The Product is non-transferable and
can only be exercised by the person whose details are provided at the time of purchase.
The User shall not take any action (or fail to take any action) that adversely affects the Lock or is
detrimental to the Company's interests or reputation. This provision is valid and enforceable
regardless of the User's awareness of the consequences. Should the Company suffer financial
harm due to such actions, the Company reserves the right to charge the full amount of the fare
increase and/or financial losses plus any associated fees.
The Product provides price protection against 100% of the locked-in fare.
The User understands that the Lock is a perishable product, and availability is subject to change.
The Company is not responsible if the Product is unavailable or sold out at the time of transaction
completion. In such cases, the Company will make its best efforts to find an alternative flight,
which the User must accept without any liability to the Company. If no alternative flight is found,
the Company will reimburse the Price Lock Fee in full.
In case of price hikes due to natural disasters, calamities, or acts of God, the Company will not
cover the same, and the Lock will be invalidated.
Users must provide accurate information regarding their identity, contact details, and other
required information at the time of purchase and be legally authorized to use the chosen payment
method. Providing false information will result in prosecution to the fullest extent of the Governing
Laws (defined below). Users must verify their selection and associated product terms before
purchase. Payment details will be verified by the Company and its payment gateway partner. All
sales are final, and the Product remains in the User's account until exercised or expired. The Lock
can only be exercised through the Company's checkout process. The Lock is not an airline ticket
and does not generate an airline PNR upon purchase.
Exercising the Lock
Exercising the Lock involves purchasing the underlying airline ticket according to the Price Lock
terms. This results in a new transaction for the ticket purchase. The User must pay the locked-in
price upon exercise. In some cases, We (Cheap Flights) may offer a lower fare than the original
locked-in fare, subject to a service fee for changing the Lock terms. The Lock can be exercised
anytime during the lock window (from the time of purchase until the lock expiration time). The
User is responsible for monitoring the lock window and exercising the Lock before expiration. It is
crucial to pay the locked-in price to complete the lock exercise.
Expiration of a Lock
A Lock, once exercised, is null and void for further use. The Lock Fee is used up and non-
refundable. If a Lock expires unexercised, the User's rights are extinguished without further value,
and no refund or exchange is permitted.
User's Online Payments
Payments can be made using Visa, MasterCard, Discover, and American Express. Cash, personal
or business checks, and other forms of payment are not accepted. The Company reserves the right
to claim any balance due to technical or other reasons. Refunds from cancellations or other
reasons will be processed to the original payment method.
LIMITATIONS
Disclaimers of Warranties: Cheap Flights provides its services and data on an informational, best-
effort basis without guarantees regarding accuracy, completeness, or timeliness. The User
understands that software is subject to errors and compatibility issues. Cheap Flights is not
responsible for damages resulting from reliance on its services.
INDEMNIFICATION
The User agrees to indemnify and hold harmless Cheap Flights, its affiliates, and representatives
from any claims, losses, expenses, liabilities, and damages arising from misrepresentation, abuse,
or breach of these terms.
Terms Subject to Change
Cheap Flights reserves the right to modify the Terms and Conditions at any time. Users will be
notified of changes, and the modified terms will be posted. Users who disagree with the new terms
may cease using the site. Failure to act on a breach does not waive Cheap Flights right to enforce
its claims.
If any part of these Terms and Conditions is found invalid or unenforceable by a court, the
remaining terms remain valid and enforceable.

General Travel Services Terms
International Travel: Passports, Visas, Disinsection and Hazards
Please be aware that travel to certain destinations may involve greater risk than other destinations.
YOU REPRESENT AND WARRANT THAT YOU MEET ALL APPLICABLE FOREIGN ENTRY
REQUIREMENTS AND HAVE ALL REQUIRED DOCUMENTATION. The Company urges you to review
travel prohibitions, warnings, announcements and advisories issued by the United States
Government prior to booking travel to international destinations. Information relating to particular
international destinations can be found at the following
websites: www.dot.gov, www.tsa.gov, www.faa.gov, www.treas.gov/ofac and www.cbp.gov.
Regarding possible foreign entry requirements, more information can be found at the following
address: https://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/country.html. For travel warnings and
advisories from the State Department, more information can be found at the following
address: https://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/alertswarnings.html For foreign health
requirements and dangers, more information can be found at the following
address: https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel
According to the Department of Transportation’s website: disinsection is permitted under
international law in order to protect public health, agriculture and the environment. The World
Health Organization and the International Civil Aviation Organization stipulate two approaches for
aircraft disinsection: (1) spray the aircraft cabin, with an aerosolized insecticide, while passengers
are on board or (2) spray or treat the aircraft's interior surfaces with a residual insecticide (residual
method) while passengers are not on board. American Samoa has adopted a third method, in
which aircraft are sprayed with an aerosolized insecticide while passengers are not on board.
Although the Report of the Informal Consultation on Aircraft Disinsection sponsored by the World
Health Organization (November 6-10, 1995) concluded that aircraft disinsection, if performed
appropriately, would not present a risk to human health. The report also noted that some
individuals may experience transient discomfort following aircraft disinsection by aerosol
application. Under the Chicago Convention, which governs international civil aviation, a country
could impose a disinsection requirement should it perceive a threat to its public health, agriculture
or environment. Accordingly, you should check with your travel agent or airline reservations agent
when booking flights or if you have questions about your final destination’s policy. For more
information about disinsection or to review a list of airline contacts for disinsection and a list of
countries that require disinsection, please visit the Department of Transportation’s website
located at the following
address: http://ostpxweb.dot.gov/policy/safetyenergyenv/disinsection.html
BY OFFERING OR FACILITATING TRAVEL TO PARTICULAR INTERNATIONAL DESTINATIONS, WE
DO NOT REPRESENT OR WARRANT THAT TRAVEL TO SUCH INTERNATIONAL DESTINATIONS IS
ADVISABLE OR WITHOUT RISK, AND WE ARE NOT LIABLE FOR DAMAGES OR LOSSES THAT MAY
RESULT FROM TRAVEL TO ANY SUCH DESTINATIONS.
Currency and Exchange Rates
Purchases made on the Website are often transacted in different currencies, depending on your IP
address and/or the currency that you select to make the purchase. You will be charged in the
currency shown upon checkout. If you use a debit or credit card to make a purchase through the
Website, please note that, due to fluctuations in exchange rates, the charge to your debit or credit
card or the estimated charge amount we provide you, may differ based on the applicable exchange
rate at the time you make your reservation compared to the exchange rate at the time the charge
is reflected on your credit or debit card statement, which may be calculated through the use of
third party application program interfaces or such other methods as we may later designate. In the
event we determine we must credit your account, we will refund the exact amount in the currency
initially charged. We will not be responsible for any exchange rate fluctuations that may cause
variances in your debit or credit card statement. Some banks and credit card companies impose
fees for transactions, without limitation for international transactions. Your bank may convert the
payment amount to your local currency and charge you a conversion fee. This means the amount
listed on your credit or bank card statement may be in your local currency and therefore a different
figure than the figure shown on the billing summary page for a reservation booked on the Website.
In addition, a foreign transaction fee may be assessed without limitation if the bank that issued
your credit card is located outside of the United States of America. Booking international travel
may be considered to be an international transaction by the bank or card company. The currency
exchange rate and foreign transaction fee is determined solely by your bank. If you have any
questions about these fees or the exchange rate applied to your booking, please contact your bank.

received from an airline, the Company and/or the airline retain the right to refuse or cancel any
requests placed for such service prior to your method of payment being charged.
Frequent Traveler Points
Frequent traveler awards, upgrades, vouchers and other discounts or incentives may not apply to
the Company’s airline services.
Code Share
Airlines often enter into what are referred to as "code share" agreements with other, select airline
partners. This means on certain travel routes, the airline carrier selling or marketing the flight does
not actually fly its own aircraft to the destination; instead, a partner airline is engaged via contract
to fly to the destination. The partner airline is typically listed as "operated by." In most cases you
will check in with your "operating" carrier; however, it is best to verify your flight check-in location
with your ticketing carrier.
Hazardous Materials
Federal law forbids the carriage of hazardous materials aboard aircraft in your luggage or on your
person. A violation can result in imprisonment for up to ten years and penalties of $250,000 or m
ore (49 U.S.C. 5124), depending on the circumstances. Hazardous materials include corrosives, r
adioactive materials, compressed gases, flammable liquids and solids, oxidizers, explosives and
poisons. Examples include tear gases, fireworks, paints, lighter fluid, oxygen bottles and radio-ph
armaceuticals. There are special exceptions for small quantities (up to 70 ounces total) of medic
inal and toilet articles carried in your luggage and certain smoking materials carried on your pers
on. See http://www.faa.gov/about/office_org/headquarters_offices/ash/ash_programs/hazmat/
passenger_info/ for additional information.
Prohibited Practices
You agree not to purchase a ticket(s) containing travel segments you will not use, such as "point-
beyond", "hidden-city", or "back-to-back tickets" if prohibited by the applicable airline. You also
agree not to purchase a round-trip ticket that you plan to use only for one-way travel if prohibited
by the applicable airline. You acknowledge that most airlines prohibit all such practices/tickets,
and that we do not guarantee the applicable airline will honor your ticket(s) if you engage in such
practices. You agree to indemnify the Covered Parties against airline claims, on the basis of these
or any other prohibited practices, for the difference between the full fare of your actual itinerary
and the value of the ticket(s) you purchased.
Flight Segments
Most airlines require flight coupons be used in sequential order. For airlines allowing use of a ticket
for only one flight segment, if you do not cancel all or part of the flight itinerary/journey you will
not use prior to the departure of any segment of your itinerary/journey, you may be forced to forfeit
the entire value or any lesser portion of your airline ticket, depending on the applicable airline’s
rules for the fare you’ve purchased.
Tax and Fee Charges on Published Price Airline Tickets
Applicable government taxes and fees and airline fees are either included in your fare or are
itemized separately on your checkout page to provide a trip cost. Tax rates in effect at the time
you purchase your fare are applied to your ticket price. Retroactive tax rate increases may be the
responsibility of the traveler. For international flights, exit and entry fees that are not included in
your trip cost or that may be itemized separately on your checkout page may also be charged. A
non-refundable fee may be applied per ticket to published price airline itineraries that include more
than one carrier. Paper ticket fees, itinerary change, cancellation or refund fees, baggage fees and
entry or exit fees on certain international flights may also apply to your itinerary. In no event shall
Company be responsible for any tax, (excepting its income tax), duty or fee.
Paper Ticket Fees
Service fees (i.e., for use of travel agencies) may be applicable and charged to you by certain third
party vendors. Such service fees can vary depending upon the vendor/agency, and may be charged
on a per ticket basis. If your itinerary requires paper tickets to be issued, shipping and handling
fees may be charged. If your tickets are returned because they have been rerouted or are
undeliverable, there may be an additional handling fee charged to you.
Itinerary Changes
Itinerary changes, if permitted by the airline fare rules, may have a change fee charged by the
applicable airline. Such change fees are charged on a per ticket basis and vary by market, airline
and specific fare rule, but typically vary between $75.00 and $300.00 (USD). Itinerary change fees
may exceed such amounts and itinerary changes may not be available. Such change fees are
charged in addition to any applicable difference between ticket prices. Additionally, any changes
to your itinerary that are made through the Company may incur additional processing fees.

done over the phone only. We will only accept refund request if the below mentioned conditions
are met:

rules allow for cancellation and refunds.
• If you are not a “no show.” “No show” refers to the situation where a passenger at the time
of boarding the flight is not present at the airport and provides no information regarding
the same to the airline. In most scenarios, a “no show” booking is ineligible for any waiver
from supplier with regard to refund processing.
• We are in a position to secure waivers from suppliers while processing the requested
cancellation and refund. However, it may not always be possible for us to do so.
We are not able to provide any specific time frame in relation to the time that may require to
process the requested refund. All the refund requests go through a stringent sequential format.
Once the request for cancellation has been placed with our customer service agent, you will then
be sent an e-mail notification from our end stating that the request has been received. However,
receiving a notification does not ensure that you will receive a refund. The e-mail notification is
just an acknowledgment that your request has been received and provides you with a tracking
number. On receiving your request for cancellation and refund, we will contact the suppliers such
as airlines, hotels and rental car companies to generate a waiver, only if it is eligible for a refund.
The decision of the supplier will be final and we will notify you about it.
Our service fees related to the original reservation or booking are non-refundable. Kindly be
informed that we are completely dependent on the suppliers' decision when it comes to receiving
the requested refunds. Please note that refunds are only possible if airline/supplier rules permit
such refunds. Once the requested refund has been approved by the supplier, it may take about 60-
90 days; from receiving your request to receiving credit on your statement. Apart from the airlines’
and other suppliers’ refund-fees, Cheap Flights will charge a post-ticketing service fee, as and when
applicable. All the refund fees charged are on per passenger, per ticket basis. The refund fees is
only applicable if a refund has been authorized by the supplier or a waiver has been received. If the
requested refund is not processed by the supplier, then in that case we will refund you the post-
ticketing service fees charged by us. However, this does not apply to our booking fees for the
original travel reservation or booking.

owed to the rental car company may vary depending on special requests you make and additional
items you may choose to purchase at the time of pick-up. The rental car company may also charge
different pricing if you deviate from the schedule you reserve (for example: if you pick up or drop
